# MNIST-Character-Recognition
Project or Neural Networking for Image Classification using MNIST handwriting characteres

* Upload all data, and visualitation as images. Check distribution to check equal sample for each digit, and not having an unbalance dataset.
* Train regular Machine Learning models (SVC, KNeighbors and Random Forest) with unprocessed data and HOG features extraction from data. 
* Train a Fully-connected Neural Network and a Convolucional Neural Network using Pytorch.
* Compare results with all models and NN.
* Analyze robustness of this models with changing positions of this images.
